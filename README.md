# reaper_tutorial_rpibsas
An script shell for all the installations and compiles of the Reaper DAW Tutorial, you will need to make some setup manually in the Reaper UI, keep that on mind! Or don't be lazy and just copy and paste from my website haha joke! 

How can i run it?:
```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Luciano2018/reaper_tutorial_rpibsas/main/rpibsas_reaper.sh | bash
```

Please connect Raspberry Pi to ethernet, for stability when you download and install, but you always can run from wifi, itÂ´s just a recomendation.
